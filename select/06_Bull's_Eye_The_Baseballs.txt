It was an evening to remember
It was night of noregrets
Oh well, I met this girl called Amber
I never forget

I met her at the restrooms
She was the queen of the night
She looked at me, and then she asked
" Are you ready for ride?"

Oh, oh, oh, this girl spins me round and round
Faster than the speed of sound
Oh, oh, oh a will follow her all over town
As long as she's around
She takes me up and down, let me feel what's real
Just to be with her, sounds like a perfect deal
Oh, oh, oh I guess it's what they call!
A shot in a bull's eye

In a rust we passed the dance floor
All the guys there outside
Then she took me to the front door
And we entered the night
We were croassing in her Chevy
Drinking whiskey in the park
She tasted like chocolate chili
When we were kissing in the dark

Oh, oh, oh, this girl spins me round and round
Faster than the speed of sound
Oh, oh, oh a will follow her all over town
As long as she's around
She takes me up and down, let me feel what's real
Just to be with her, sounds like a perfect deal
Oh, oh, oh I guess it's what they call!
A shot in a bull's eye

At the break of dawn, she said:
" I guess I'll leave right now
We had something really special here
But it'll come to an end any how
My mama used to say to me:
Always end on a high note
So i'm going away, let the memory stay
And wish you a wonderful, wonderful day"

Oh, oh, oh, this girl spins me round and round
Faster than the speed of sound
Oh, oh, oh a will follow her all over town
As long as she's around
She takes me up and down, let me feel what's real
Just to be with her, sounds like a perfect deal
Oh, oh, oh I guess it's what they call!
A shot in a bull's eye
